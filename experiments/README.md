# Experiments With AgML

This directory contains experiments which have been conducted using AgML. These experiments are primarily
artifacts of prior AgML development which has been either removed, or adapted in a new format. These source files
are meant to serve as potential examples for AgML usage, but do not necessarily reflect the updated API, so they are
not necessarily guaranteed to work; rather they are here for inspiration and examples.
