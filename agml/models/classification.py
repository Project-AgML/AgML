    When using the model for inference, you should use the `predict()` method
    on any set of input images. This method wraps the `forward()` call with
    additional steps which perform the necessary preprocessing on the inputs,
    including resizing, normalization, and batching, as well as additional
    post-processing on the outputs (such as converting one-hot labels to
    integer labels), which will allow for a streamlined inference pipeline.

    If you want to use the `forward()` method directly, so that you can just
    call `model(inputs)`, then make sure your inputs are properly processed.
    This can be done by calling `model.preprocess_input(inputs)` on the
    input list of images/single image and then passing that result to the model.
    This will also return a one-hot label feature vector instead of integer
    labels, in the case that you want further customization of the outputs.

    This model can be subclassed in order to run a full training job; the
    actual transfer `EfficientNetB4` model can be accessed through the
    parameter `net`, and you'll need to implement methods like `training_step`,
    `configure_optimizers`, etc. See PyTorch Lightning for more information.

        This method takes in a set of inputs and preprocesses them into the
        expected format for the `EfficientNetB4` image classification model.
        There are a variety of inputs which are accepted, including images,
        image paths, as well as fully-processed image tensors. The inputs
        are expanded and standardized, then run through a preprocessing
        pipeline which formats them into a single tensor ready for the model.

        Preprocessing steps include normalization, resizing, and converting
        to the channels-first format used by PyTorch models. The output
        of this method will be a single `torch.Tensor`, which has shape
        [N, C, H, W], where `N` is the batch dimension. If only a single
        image is passed, this will have a value of 1.

        This method is largely beneficial when you just want to preprocess
        images into the specification of the model, without getting the output.
        Namely, `predict()` is essentially just a wrapper around this method
        and `forward()`, so you can run this externally and then run `forward()`
        to get the original model outputs, without any extra post-processing.

        Parameters
        ----------
        images : Any
            One of the following formats (and types):
                1. A single image path (str)
                2. A list of image paths (List[str])
                3. A single image (np.ndarray, torch.Tensor)
                4. A list of images (List[np.ndarray, torch.Tensor])
                5. A batched tensor of images (np.ndarray, torch.Tensor)

        Returns
        -------
        A 4-dimensional, preprocessed `torch.Tensor`.

        This method is the primary inference method for the model; it
        accepts a set of input images (see `preprocess_input()` for a
        detailed specification on the allowed input parameters), then
        preprocesses them to the model specifications, forward passes
        them through the model, and finally returns the predictions.

        In essence, this method is a wrapper for `forward()` that allows
        for passing a variety of inputs. If, on the other hand, you
        have pre-processed inputs and simply want to forward pass through
        the model without having to spend computational time on what
        is now unnecessary preprocessing, you can simply call `forward()`

        ----------
