Weed identification at early growth stage contributes to reduced herbicide rates. However, while computer vision alongside deep learning have overcome the performance of approaches that use hand-crafted features, there are still some open challenges in the development of a reliable automatic plant identification system. These type of systems have to take into account different sources of variability, such as growth stages and soil conditions, with the added constraint of the limited size of usual datasets. This study proposes a novel crop/weed identification system that relies on a combination of fine-tuning pre-trained convolutional networks (Xception, Inception-Resnet, VGNets, Mobilenet and Densenet) with the \u201ctraditional\u201d machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machines, XGBoost and Logistic Regression) trained with the previously deep extracted features. The aim of this approach was to avoid overfitting and to obtain a robust and consistent performance. To evaluate this approach, an open access dataset of two crop [tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)] and two weed species [black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.) and velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medik.)] was generated. The pictures were taken by different production sites across Greece under natural variable light conditions from RGB cameras. The results revealed that a combination of fine-tuned Densenet and Support Vector Machine achieved a micro F1 score of 99.29% with a very low performance difference between train and test sets. Other evaluated approaches also obtained repeatedly more than 95% F1 score. Additionally, our results analysis provides some heuristics for designing transfer-learning based systems to avoid overfitting without decreasing performance.}\n}"

Majority of works focus on developing robotics for croplands, ignoring the weed management problems facing rangeland stock farmers. Perhaps the greatest obstacle to widespread uptake of robotic weed control is the robust classification of weed species in their natural environment. The unparalleled successes of deep learning make it an ideal candidate for recognising various weed species in the complex rangeland environment. This work contributes the first large, public, multiclass image dataset of weed species from the Australian rangelands; allowing for the development of robust classification methods to make robotic weed control viable. The DeepWeeds dataset consists of 17,509 labelled images of eight nationally significant weed species native to eight locations across northern Australia. This paper presents a baseline for classification performance on the dataset using the benchmark deep learning models, Inception-v3 and ResNet-50. These models achieved an average classification accuracy of 95.1{\\%} and 95.7{\\%}, respectively. We also demonstrate real time performance of the ResNet-50 architecture, with an average inference time of 53.4 ms per image.

The aim is to build an accurate, fast and reliable fruit detection system, which is a vital element of an autonomous agricultural robotic platform; it is a key element for fruit yield estimation and automated harvesting. Recent work in deep neural networks has led to the development of a state-of-the-art object detector termed Faster Region-based CNN (Faster R-CNN). We adapt this model, through transfer learning, for the task of fruit detection using imagery obtained from two modalities: colour (RGB) and Near-Infrared (NIR). Early and late fusion methods are explored for combining the multi-modal (RGB and NIR) information. This leads to a novel multi-modal Faster R-CNN model, which achieves state-of-the-art results compared to prior work with the F1 score, which takes into account both precision and recall performances improving from     0 . 807     to     0 . 838     for the detection of sweet pepper. In addition to improved accuracy, this approach is also much quicker to deploy for new fruits, as it requires bounding box annotation rather than pixel-level annotation (annotating bounding boxes is approximately an order of magnitude quicker to perform). The model is retrained to perform the detection of seven fruits, with the entire process taking four hours to annotate and train the new model per fruit.},\n  DOI = {10.3390/s16081222}\n}"

One of the main objectives of deep learning for smart farming is to identify the precise location of weeds and crops on farmland. In this paper, we propose a semantic segmentation method based on a cascaded encoder-decoder network, namely CED-Net, to differentiate weeds from crops. The existing architectures for weeds and crops segmentation are quite deep, with millions of parameters that require longer training time. To overcome such limitations, we propose an idea of training small networks in cascade to obtain coarse-to-fine predictions, which are then combined to produce the final results. Evaluation of the proposed network and comparison with other state-of-the-art networks are conducted using four publicly available datasets: rice seeding and weed dataset, BoniRob dataset, carrot crop vs. weed dataset, and a paddy&ndash;millet dataset. The experimental results and their comparisons proclaim that the proposed network outperforms state-of-the-art architectures, such as U-Net, SegNet, FCN-8s, and DeepLabv3, over intersection over union (IoU), F1-score, sensitivity, true detection rate, and average precision comparison metrics by utilizing only (1/5.74 &times; U-Net), (1/5.77 &times; SegNet), (1/3.04 &times; FCN-8s), and (1/3.24 &times; DeepLabv3) fractions of total parameters.},\n  DOI = {10.3390/electronics9101602}\n}"

Additional plug-ins are also available for visualizing model geometry and data and for processing and integrating LiDAR scanning data. Many of the plug-ins perform calculations on the graphics processing unit, which allows for efficient simulation of very large domains with high detail.
